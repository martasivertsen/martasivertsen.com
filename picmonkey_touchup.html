                      makes super complicated photoshop tricks, a breeze and ease to pick up. It was a no brainer to
                      add this feature for the PicMonkey mobile app. I was the design lead for this project working closely
                      with product and development to launch an even easier Touch Up tool for mobile.

                            <p>After the launch of the PicMonkey Mobile app we quickly discovered the biggest missing in
                            the app for our current users was the Touch Up feature for mobile.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The goal was to fast follow
                            the launch of the app with the most loved Touch Up features on .com. In addition the business
                            hoped to use this opportunity monetize the app by making Touch Up a pay to play feature. Lastly,
                            we saw this as an opportunity to improve the desktop Touch Up experience for mobile and apply advanced
                            technologies like face recognition.

                                design challenges was fitting this new technology into the current app's tool language.
                                It was important to reuse controls found in other editing tools, so this new feature felt
                                familiar and easy to dive into.

                        utilize face recognition, and would allow users to apply and adjust effects in a single session.

                              to preview where it's being applied is important.

                        mobile device. I wanted to get the entire team involved in user testing, so had a dev pair with
                        me during each study to take notes and observe. This was super valuable in getting the entire

                              amount of complexity balanced with ease of use. As our first monetized component in the
                              app, we learned that we have higher conversions if we put a hard paywall in front of a
