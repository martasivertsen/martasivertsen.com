                            adding new features like facial recognition to improve the experience. From the business
                            side this new tool would be an opportunity to monetize the app by making Touch Up a paid feature.

                        awareness of usability concerns.

                        engineers to brainstorm how to adjust the tool so it was more sensitive with a dramatic effect.
                        We also added a touch indicator to establish that the other tools of Nip Tuck, "Reduce" and "Fill",
                        were tap-only effects, while "Melt" was a paint-only effect. Lastly, we changed the name of the
