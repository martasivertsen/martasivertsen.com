                      <h4 class="">PicMonkey is a often described as a web-based photo editing tool that's as easy
                      to use as Instagram, but as robust as Photoshop. When I joined PicMonkey, I was tasked with
                      designing a mobile app for iOS and Android that continued that theme of easy, robust photo editing. We
                      were a bit behind competitors with releasing a mobile app, so it was important that we move fast,
                      be in parity, and find ways to stand out. I was the sole designer on a team of 9 developers, so
                      I needed to work smart, be efficient, work in an agile way and nothing was precious.

                              <p>Initially the mobile product was focused around communition, but when I came on board we shifted
                                towards providing a basic but smart photo editing app, keep PicMonkey competitive in the market, and
                                provide our users a quick bridge to picmonkey.com via cloud storage. As we refocused towards photo
                                editing we wanted to stand apart in the market with ability to apply and edit multiple effects in a
                                session and precise effect application via paint on effects.

                                    <small>In the early stages, I pared with director of development to brainstorm daily
                                    design concepts sketching ideas on a whiteboard in a quick, loose, and iterative way.

                                    design was finalized. It was also a way to make design a larger conversation, not just
                                    something design owns.

                              <p>The final product was a fun, light weight tool, with stickers and text surprising the team with their
                              popularity. Analyzing analytics also showed that users spent a significant amount of time in session photo editing.
                              Though we deemed the launch as successful, we had a vocal minority of current PicMonkey.com users that were
                              frustrated the mobile app's features were not in parity with PicMonkey.com. One of those features that
                              was missing was Touch Up, which would become the next product feature. What I would do differently is gather user
                              input early to what features would they want to see in this app.
