                  <h4>While working at Getty Images I worked with a volunteer group that put on an internal fundraising
                    campaign for the Seattle non-profit, ArtsFund. As Getty Images represents many photographers, ArtsFund was a perfect
                    organization for us to support. I was in charge of creating the message, theme, and all marketing materials.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ArtsFund has a key role in supporting the arts community in Seattle. Getty Images wanted to get employees excited
                    about supportting the arts and give back to the community. I was a designer on the fundraising commitee and voluteered
                     to create all marketing and printed event materials.
                    Getty Images and ArtsFund were perfect paring for launching an interval fundraising campaign to connect and give back
                    to the Seattle community. Also a lover of art I saw unique opportunity to be a supporter and volunteered to design
                    and create all marketing materials for the event. While an UX Designer at Getty Images, I volunteered to lead the
                    design effort for an employee fundraising compaign for ArtsFund.Getty Images selected ArtsFund as a local
                    organization to give back to because Getty Images as an organization is built of award winning photographt and artists. </h4>

                        <h3>Art surrounds us</h3>
                        <p>When you work at Getty Images you start to forget about the stunning collection of photography that
                          you work with every day. The major focus of this fundraising campaign was to remind people that art
                          really does surround us. I hand-selected a spectrum of colorful, textural photographs that capture
                          art in progress.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          showcase the deep archive of beautiful, interesting, and life capturing .&nbsp  e wanted to reemphasize to employees at Getty Images the diverse, inspiring spectrum of photography we that as a collective we are supporting and distributing throuhg the world. Art is always around us and is really part of our everyday.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          It was important to help remind Getty Images employees how much they are surrounded by award winning photography and art. As a result we decided to showcase a unique collection of images from Getty Images library throughout all of the marketing materials. And Getty Images is key player in capturing art around the world. How do we get Getty Images employees enganged in giving back to the community. Remind folks that we are surrounded by award winning photography and art everyday. Showcase within the company the very work that we promote.</p>

                    I created invites, posters, and digital media which

                    emphasized the theme, life with art<br/>

When designing the promotional materials for the fundraiser, I featured the selected images, highlighting the theme
of "life with art" <br/>

                    <p>In order to promote the fundraiser, I featured the selected images on
