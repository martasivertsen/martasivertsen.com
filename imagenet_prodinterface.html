                <p class="">Image.net is a site owned by Getty Images that provides free publicity photos and videos to media clients.  The site distributes content provided by industry clients.  I was tasked with updating the UX of the site section devoted to helping those industry clients manage the content that they make available through the site. The updates need to meet specific client concerns and to improve the client experience when navigating the site and uploading content.</p>

                    <p class="subquote">The benefit and downfall of one design was that we were attempting to display the entire folder structure, from the top product categories to the final assets. This was useful, but also provided a lot of information for the user to parse.</p>

                    <p class="subquote">The second design solved for the complex hierarchy of the first by collapsing the product list into a drop down menu. This worked because users tend to spend more time navigating the lower parts of the hierarchy, but it also introduced a new way of thinking that was both embraced and questioned by the users we tested.</p>

                    <p class="subquote">Users were leaning more towards having easy access to image details versus folder permissions. They were getting a larger image preview than what we had previously, but we still needed to find a better solution.</p>
