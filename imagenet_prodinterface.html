                            amount of time to onramp new users. The main user goals that we wanted to target and improve upon
                            were being able to move images between folders faster, view folder permissions more easily,
                            and scroll through images quickly to then approve or deny media access.

                              small set of users. All users tested were site admins that used the site on a daily basis.
                              The designs tested focused on improving folder access so assets could be moved from folder
                              to folder more easily, providing a way to scroll through images for quicker approval or
                              denial, and quicker access to folder permissions.

                              <small>We confirmed that providing folder permissions was highly desirable, but it needed to
                              be more clear how they could be accessed. A simple expand or close control was not enough.

                              structure for quick drag and drop. The challenge was to figure out how to equally

                              still want to be able to see the image at a much larger size.</p>
                              <small>Users were leaning more towards having easy access to image details versus
                              folder structure and their permissions. They were getting a larger image preview than what
                              we had previously, but it needed to be larger in order to properly view the image.</small>

                              <p>As we moved from wireframes to visual design, I started to define a visual language
                              based on the current structure, but with a modern, fresh take. The main goal was to update
                              the visuals through flat ui elements and larger more touchable links to improve navigation.

                              contents and folder permissions. Instead of an inline image preview a full screen image
                              preview was included in order to zoom and analyze the image. This new view also allowed the user
                              to scroll through a series of photos and approve or deny along the way. In addition, we
                              collapsed the previous left sided product list into a top level menu.
