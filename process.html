                                    first step before starting design work should be to clearly understand the problem

                                    goals and define user pain points that we are hoping to improve.

                                    An analysis could just be screen shots to hang on a wall or a formal document to share
                                    with the broader team. The goal is to understand what’s working and what’s missing

                                    analytics or a more extensive project working in tandem with a researcher to
                                    create, send, and analyze survey data. At this stage any information that I can
                                    glean about the user and their intentions or desires is invaluable.

                                    Prototyping has become essential to my design process, as the digital
                                    world has become more interactive. The in-between moments can help or hinder a user
                                    experience and prototypes test those moments.

                                    <p>I set up frequent check-ins during the iteration phase as critical components to
                                    improving the design. I enjoy working on teams where it's common to have quick
                                    desk side reviews with other designers throughout the day. It's also important to
                                    involve development in weekly reviews where we go through
                                    updates, get feedback and answer questions. The dev reviews are also a place for
                                    product and other key stakeholders to observe and get up to speed.

                                    <p>When a prototype is ready or the design is closer to final, it's a great time to
                                    gather user feedback through usability testing. If traditional testing is
                                    not feasible I often do adhoc tests with other employees outside of the team.
                                    Gathering feedback and gaining a perspective into how the solution is being
                                    received and understood is critical to designing an intuitive product.
